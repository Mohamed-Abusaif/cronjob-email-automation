# Weekly Email Automation with Node.js and node-cron

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use **Node.js** in conjunction with the **node-cron** package to automate sending weekly email updates to a list of emails. The system ensures that emails are sent at a specific time every week without manual intervention, helping to streamline communication.

## Objectives

- Automate the process of sending emails to a predefined list of emails.
- Schedule email delivery to occur weekly using the `node-cron` library.
- Ensure email content includes updates and relevant information for the week.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **node-cron**: A task scheduling library for Node.js that allows the execution of code at specified intervals.
- **Email Service**: Configure an SMTP email service provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, or any custom SMTP server).

## Features

- Automated scheduling of email tasks with `node-cron`.
- Integration with an SMTP server for sending emails.
- Weekly updates sent consistently at the specified time.
- Logging to track the success or failure of email deliveries.

## Workflow

1. **Define Email Content**: Prepare the email template, including placeholders for weekly updates.
2. **Configure Cron Job**: Set up a weekly schedule using the `node-cron` package.
3. **Send Emails**: Use an email-sending library like `nodemailer` to handle email transmission.
4. **Log Results**: Log successful and failed attempts to send emails for debugging purposes.

## Advantages

- Saves time by automating repetitive email tasks.
- Ensures timely communication without manual reminders.
- Scalable to accommodate additional recipients or different schedules.
